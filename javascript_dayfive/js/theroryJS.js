/*
   Worlds most Popular programming language  of the Web
   As web developer you must know about JS, HTML and CSS
   JS to  program the behavior of web pages
   You dont have to download or get JS to run your script file or program.
   Javascript is already running in your web browser on your computer , on your tablet, and on your smart phone.
   Javascript is free to use for everyone.

   How JS helps ?
   It can change HTML content

   You have to write some logic or code inside your HTML to change the HTML content.
   <!-- script src="firstJs.js"></script -->
    
   One of many JS HTML methods is getElementById()

   JS and Java both are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
   JS was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became and ECMA standard in 1997.
   ECMA -262 is the official name of the standard.
   ECMAScript is the official name of the language


   Advantages of using external JS 
   1. It separate HTML and code
   2. It makes HTML and JS easier to read and maintain
   3. Cached JS files can speed up page loads.


   JS can display data in different ways:-
   1. Writing into an HTML element using innerHTML.
   2. Writing into the HTML o/p using document.write()
   3.Writing into an alert box, using window.alert()
   4. Writing into the browser console, using console.log()

  1. Using innerHTML
        To access an HTML element, JS can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
        The id attribute defines the HTML element.
        The innerHTML property defines the HTML content.
        Changing the innerHTML property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML.

  2. Using document.write()
      document.write()

      JS Keywords:
        JS statements often start with a keyword to identify the JS action to be performed.
        1. break         Terminates a switch or a loop
        2. continue         Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top
        3. debugger         Stops the execution of JS, and calls(if available) the debugging function
        4. do ... while      Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true.
        5. for                   Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true
        6. function                 Declares a function
        7. if ... else              Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition
        8. return                   Exits a function
        9. switch                  Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases
        10. try ... catch        Implements error handling to a block of statements
        11. var          to Declare a variable

        Before 2015, using the var keyword was the only way to declare a JS variable
        Javascript verison (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015) allows the use of the const and let keyword
        Using const keyword you can define a variable that cannot be reassigned, and 
        the let keyword to define a variable with restricted scope.
